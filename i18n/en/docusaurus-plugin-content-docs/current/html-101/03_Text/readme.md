HTML provides a large number of text tags for us to use when making web pages. These tags can help us better organize and format our text content. Below are some commonly used HTML text tags.

## `<p>`: Paragraph tag

The `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph. It adds a line break before and after the paragraph, making the paragraphs clearly distinguishable.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
<p>This is another paragraph. </p>
```

Effect in browser:

<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
<p>This is another paragraph. </p>



## `<h1>` to `<h6>`: title tags

These tags are used to define HTML titles. `<h1>` defines the largest heading, `<h6>` defines the smallest heading.

```html
<h1>This is an h1 title</h1>
<h2>This is an h2 title</h2>
...
<h6>This is an h6 title</h6>
```

Effect in browser:
<h1>This is an h1 title</h1>
<h2>This is an h2 title</h2>
...
<h6>This is an h6 title</h6>

## `<br>`: line break tag

The `<br>` tag is used to insert a simple newline character.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph. <br>This is a new line in the same paragraph. </p>
```

Effect in browser:

<p>This is a paragraph. <br>This is a new line in the same paragraph. </p>

## `<strong>`: Bold label

The `<strong>` tag is used to define emphasized text, which browsers usually display as bold.

```html
<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text. </p>
```

Effect in browser:

<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text. </p>

## `<em>`: italic tag

The `<em>` tag is used to define emphasized text, which browsers usually display in italics.

```html
<p>This is <em>italic</em> text. </p>
```

Effect in browser:

<p>This is <em>italic</em> text. </p>


## `<u>`: Underline tag

The `<u>` tag is used to define underlined text.

```html
<p>This is <u>underlined</u> text. </p>
```

Effect in browser:
<p>This is <u>underlined</u> text. </p>

## `<del>`: strikethrough tag

The `<del>` tag is used to display text that has been deleted, and browsers usually add a horizontal line above it.

```html
<p>This is <del>deleted</del> text. </p>
```

Effect in browser:
<p>This is <del>deleted</del> text. </p>

## `<mark>`: Highlight tags

The `<mark>` tag is used to define marked or highlighted text.

```html
<p>This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> text. </p>
```
Effect in browser:
<p>This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> text. </p>


## `<sub>` and `<sup>`: subscript and superscript tags

`<sub>` is used to define subscript text, and `<sup>` is used to define superscript text.

```html
<p>This is an example of <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>. </p>
```
Effect in browser:
<p>This is an example of <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>. </p>
